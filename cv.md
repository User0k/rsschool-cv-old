### About

My first commercial experience was in about 2005 when I was passionate about 3DS Max. I was translating some tutorials into Russian and got some projects to do. Unfortunately, the disappointment came rather quickly when I found out that most employers were looking a 3D modeller and an artist at the same time. I have never pretended to be an artist.

Next was a long-term career in a printing center. I entered as a complete beginner, and step by step has become a head of production department. Later I realized I have achieved everything I could in my current position. Plus with the development of remote services and jobs the industry is slowly dying.

So I decided to look for something perspective I can be good at, and discovered a frontend development. I have started with HTMLAcademy and then watched tons of courses and tutorials, realized some small projects. [Old good Pacman game realization]https://github.com/User0k/PacMan-online
